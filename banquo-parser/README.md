# Banquo Parser (WIP)

This crate contains the types and implementations used by the banquo temporal logic monitoring
library to support parsing formulas from text. This library is not intended to be used directly,
instead you should install the [banquo](https://crates.io/banquo) crate instead with the
`parser` feature enabled.

This crate is not yet ready for use.
