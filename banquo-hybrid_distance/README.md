# Banquo Hybrid Distance

This crate contains the types and implementations used by the banquo temporal logic monitoring
library for supporting the hybrid distance metric. This library is not intended to be used directly,
instead you should install the [banquo](https://crates.io/banquo) crate instead with the
`hybrid-distance` feature enabled.

## Structs
